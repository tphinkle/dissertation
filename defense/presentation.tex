\begin{frame}[c]{Resistive pulse sensing---how does it work?}

	\begin{tiny}
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item Particles are suspended in a conductive solution, which is injected into a pore/channel system
			\item An external voltage is applied across the channel, which induces an ionic current---the channel acts as an Ohmic resistor with governing equation $V=IR$, where $V$ is the applied voltage, $I$ the measured current, and $R$ the electrical resistance of the channel
			\item When a particle enters the channel its resistance changes, yielding a transient change in the measured ionic current
			\item By studying the properties of the current pulse, particle properties such as size, concentration, charge, and shape may be elucidated
		\end{itemize}
