%% Usually I would leave this on
%% However, there seems to be problems with XeLaTeX
%% http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29497/xelatex-preventing-beamer-from-using-different-backgrounds
\setbeamertemplate{background canvas}[vertical shading][bottom=blue!.1, middle=white, top=white]

%% HOWEVER: it seems to make it impossible to change this later on in the document


%% For a dark background: 
% \setbeamertemplate{background canvas}[vertical shading][bottom=keynotebottom, middle=keynotemiddle, top=keynotetop]


%% An alternate way: \beamertemplateshadingbackground{blue!.1}{red!2}
%% In general: you want the gradient to be subtle!
