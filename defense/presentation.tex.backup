			\item The volume occupied by the particle no longer contains conductive solution

% RP-IM motivation 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation---Why introduce optics?}
	
	In an RP experiment, the usual parameters measured are amplitude and duration, which can relate to particle's volume, charge, etc. \\
	\vspace{.3in}
	But, the equations which relate the RP signal to physical observables are only accurate under restrictive conditions or approximations that are seldom met in experimental systems \\
	\vspace{.3in}
 	In reality, the experimental set up can never be constrained to this degree \\
 	

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RP-IM motivation 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation---Why introduce optics?}
	

	
	Some confounding factors include
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Entrance effects in low or medium aspect ratio pores
		\item Non-spheroidal particles, rotational effects
		\item Off-axis translocation
	\end{itemize}
	
	The influence of each of these effects on the RP signal is difficult to measure

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RP-IM motivation 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation---Why introduce optics?}
	
	What if we could \textit{see} what is happening during a resistive pulse experiment? 
	
	\vspace{.2in}
	
	Then we could determine the influence of these confounding factors during the event translocation \\
	
	\vspace{.2in}
	
	For instance, we could directly observe the effect of off-axis translocation on the resistive pulse signal
	
	\vspace{.2in}
	
	The results would generalize to other resistive pulse experiments and lead to greater interpretability of the RP signals!  \\

	But, the trouble is that directly imaging nanoscale resistive pulse experiments is extremely difficult; need an electron microscope that can operate \textit{in situ}
	
	\vspace{.2in}
	
	However, at the microscale we can use plain optics to image the experiments while simultaneously measuring the resistive pulses
	
	\vspace{.2in}
	
	The results should generalize to the nanoscale as well, since the confounding factors arise due to electrostatic boundary conditions that are scale independent

% Key scientific questions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[c]{Key scientific questions}
	  
	Experiments must be conducted to answer the following questions
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Do the cells deform according to the presented motif?
		\item Is the deformation observable in the resistive pulse signal?
	\end{enumerate}

	The hybrid RP-IM system is employed to characterize the device and the cells' resistive pulses \\
	\vspace{0.1in}
	Ultimately, the goal is to remove the camera from the set up and measure deformability with resistive pulse alone \\

\begin{frame}[c]{Data analysis}

	Individual cells were detected and tracked as they passed through the camera's field of view \\
	To determine whether particles deform, we fit ellipses to their borders at every frame in the video \\
	After fitting the ellipses, we have a time-series of position $\vec{x}_{c}$, and ellipse axes $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ for each frame and each particle
