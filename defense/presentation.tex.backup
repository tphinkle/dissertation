		\item What about channels with rough or non-constant width interiors?

		\item In regions of low diameter, the pulse is deeper; in large diameter regions, the pulse is shallow
		\item Particles shorter than the length scale of diameter variation accurately map the pore interiors
		\item Particles longer than the length scale of diameter variation create RP signals that can be seen as a convolution of the pore's interior shape
