\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces Four important length scales for fluidics and surface forces. \textbf {milli-}: Caenorhabditis elegans (\textit {c. elegans}) sample, approximately 1 mm in length. Surface tension and capillary forces become significant at this length scale. Fluid dynamics is described by the complete Navier-Stokes equations. \textbf {micro-}: HCT-116 (colorectal cancer) cells, approximately $\SI {10}{\mu m}$ in diameter. Surface effects become increasingly important. Gravity becomes increasingly negligible, and systems under small applied pressures are described by having low-Reynolds number. \textbf {nano-}: A protein. Fluidic systems are dominated by surface forces. Liquid within $\SI {1}{nm}$ of surfaces is entirely contained within the electrical double layer. Fluid is completely non-inertial. \textbf {sub nano-}: A water molecule. Mean-field approximations are no longer valid. Navier-Stokes breaks down. Physics is determined entirely by electrostatic and Van der Waals forces between individual atoms and molecules.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.10}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.5}{\ignorespaces \textbf {Ion concentrations adjacent to a negatively charged surface according to the Debye-Huckel theory.} The plot reveals that the counterion concentration (blue) is enhanced near the wall, and decays approximately exponentially as distance from the wall increases. Oppositely, coions (red) are diminished near the wall, and rise to their bulk value with distance from the wall. The \textit {total} ion concentration at the pore surface is slightly higher than the total ion concentration in the bulk. The space charge density $\rho _{E}\propto \left [c_{+}\left (y\right )-c_{-}\left (y\right )\right ]$ is non-zero near the wall, and decays to zero in the bulk.\relax }}{22}{figure.caption.13}

A net ion charge at the surface experiences a force in an electric field which drags fluid along with it. The force is only present in the electrical double layer, which viscously couples to the rest of the fluid. This fluid flow profile is known as plug flow, and extends far beyond the EDL where it originates.\relax }}{26}{figure.caption.14}
